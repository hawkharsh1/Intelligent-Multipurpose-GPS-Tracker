## 🚀 Features

- 📍 Real-time GPS tracking
- 📡 SMS-based location sharing with Google Maps link
- 📊 Data storage and retrieval via Firebase Realtime Database
- 📈 Predictive analytics using AI/ML (planned)
- 🔐 SOS feature for emergency alerts
- 🔋 Power-efficient hardware design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Hardware:
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- NEO-6M GPS Module
- SIM800L GSM Module
- A9G Module (for GPS/GSM integration)
- Rechargeable battery with power management

### Software:
- Embedded C++ for ESP32
- FirebaseESP32 Library
- Google Firebase (Realtime DB)
- Google Maps for location visualization
- AT commands for GSM communication
- Future scope: AI/ML models for behavior analysis and prediction

---

## 📱 How It Works

1. Device fetches current location using the A9G/Neo-6M module.
2. Location is pushed to Firebase (latitude, longitude, timestamp).
3. A Google Maps link is generated and sent via SMS to a predefined SOS number.
4. Data is updated every 30 seconds.
